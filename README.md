# Classification Models
![Marketing](https://img.shields.io/badge/Marketing-Data%20Analysis-blue)
The goal of this project is to predict the success of the marketing campaign based on the available features and to evaluate the performance of different classifiers.

To achieve this, we will use various classification techniques and tools, such as:
* Logistic regression
* Decision tree
* Support vector machine
* Neural network ensemble 
classifiers. 

We will also perform grid search to tune hyperparameters and data sensitivity analysis to obtain the most relevant features for each model. 

Finally, we will compare the performance of the classifiers using ROC, Lift, and Gain curves, which are widely used metrics in marketing campaigns to evaluate the quality of the classifier and optimize the campaign. 

Through this project, we hope to provide some valuable insights and recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the marketing campaign.
